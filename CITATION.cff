abstract: >
  A hybrid Rust/C++ runtime designed to optimize memory throughput across the PCIe bus 
  for Large Language Model offloading. The engine achieved a 90.7% throughput improvement 
  on NVIDIA Tesla T4 hardware (reaching 12.31 GB/s) by implementing asynchronous 
  multi-streaming and pinned memory orchestration.
